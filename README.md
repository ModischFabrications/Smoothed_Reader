# Smoothed Reader
This Reader can be used to smooth out analog values with averages and more.
Look at main.cpp to see how this class is used. 
Be aware that readers can be cascaded.

This is also a convenient resource on how to convert microphone readings from 
a sensor board like the MAX4466 into an usable amplitude for 1 bar equalizers.
